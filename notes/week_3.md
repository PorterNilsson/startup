## CSS Introduction

- Functionally, CSS is primarily concerned with defining `rulesets`, or simply `rules`. A rule is comprised of a `selector` that selects the elements to apply the rule to, and one or more `declarations` that represent the `property` to style with the given `property value`.
- 3 Ways to Use CSS
    - ```HTML
        <p style="color:green">CSS</p>
        ```
        
    - ```HTML
        <head>
          <style>
            p {
              color: green;
            }
          </style>
        </head>
        <body>
          <p>CSS</p>
        </body>
        ```
        
    - ```HTML
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
        ```
        
        - Must appear in the head
- The "lowest" or most specific level of style is the one that is ultimately applied
    - Change allÂ `box-sizing` to `border-box`

## Selectors

- You can select by element name
    - ```CSS
        body {
          font-family: sans-serif;
        }
        ```
        
- | Combinator | Meaning | Example | Description |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Descendant | A list of descendants | `body section` | Any section that is a descendant of a body |
    | Child | A list of direct children | `section > p` | Any p that is a direct child of a section |
    | General sibling | A list of siblings | `div ~ p` | Any p that has a div sibling |
    | Adjacent sibling | A list of adjacent sibling | `div + p` | Any p that has an adjacent div sibling |
    
- Use a period before a class name to select all elements with that class. Optionally, place the element type before the period such as "p.className" to select only those type of elements with that class.
- Signify ID with "#"
- You can use attribute selectors as well with "\[\]" syntax
- Pseudo-selectors are invoked with ":" syntax to specify behavior that occurs as a result of interaction with the element in some manner
