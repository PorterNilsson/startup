# Week 2

## Git and Github

- Use `git diff` followed by `HEAD` or `HEAD~<number>` to compare commits.
- Use `git branch <name>` to create a new branch.
- Use `git checkout <branch name>` to changing working branch.
- After a number of commits (or a finished feature), return to the main branch and run `git merge <branch name>`.
- Use `git fetch` and `git status` to check for merge conflicts before pulling.
- A typical git workflow will involve pulling, adding, committing, and pushing.

## Asking Questions

- Research in advance
- Write a summarizing title
- Introduce the problem
- Help others reproduce the problem
- Include all relevant tags (versioning information)
- Proofread
- Respond to feedback (especially initially to avoid an obvious error in the question)
