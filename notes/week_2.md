# Week 2

## Git and Github

- Use `git diff` followed by `HEAD` or `HEAD~<number>` to compare commits.
- Use `git branch <name>` to create a new branch.
- Use `git checkout <branch name>` to changing working branch.
- After a number of commits (or a finished feature), return to the main branch and run `git merge <branch name>`.
- Use `git fetch` and `git status` to check for merge conflicts before pulling.
- Use `git log` to see commit history with associated hashes
- A typical git workflow will involve pulling, adding, committing, and pushing.

## Asking Questions

- Research in advance
- Write a summarizing title
- Introduce the problem
- Help others reproduce the problem
- Include all relevant tags (versioning information)

## A brief history of web programming

Three Phases

1.  The formation of the internet that supports the communication of web applications
2.  The creation of HTML and HTTP that made it possible to shared hyperlinked documents (Web 1.0).
3.  The creation of CSS and JavaScript that enabled interactive web applications (Web 2.0).

- The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) defines the technical standards that specify how the physical network communicates.
- The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) oversees both the Internet Protocol (IP) address space, and the Domain Name System (DNS).
- Example HTTP Request
    - ```HTTP
        GET /hypertext/WWW/Helping.html HTTP/1.1
        Host: info.cern.ch
        Accept: text/html
        ```
        
- Javascript follows the ECMAScript standard
