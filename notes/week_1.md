# Week 1

## Git and Github
- Use 'git diff' followed by 'HEAD' or 'HEAD~\<number>' to compare commits.
- Use 'git branch \<name>' to create a new branch.
- Use 'git checkout \<branch name>' to changing working branch.
- After a number of commits (or a finished feature), return to the main branch and run 'git merge \<branch name>'.
- Use 'git fetch' and 'git status' to check for merge conflicts before pulling.
- A typical git workflow will involve pulling, adding, commiting, and pushing.
